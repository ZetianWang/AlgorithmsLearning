Computational complexity. Framework to study efficiency of algorithms for solving a particular problem X

Model of computation. Allowable operations, decision tree
Cost model. Operation counts, # of compares 
Upper bound. Cost guarantee provided by some algorithms for X, ~NlgN from mergesort
Lower bound. Proven limit on cost guarantee of all algorithms for X, ?
Optimal algorithm. Algorithm with best possible cost guarantess for X, ?

Decision tree (for 3 distinct items a, b, c) 
3 compares at most
height of tree = worst case number of compares 

Compare-based lower bound for sorting.
Any compare-based sorting algorithm must use at least lg(N!) ~ NlgN compares in the worst-case
