Comparable interface: sort using a type's natural order 
Comparator interface: sort using an alternate order 

Stability
A stable sort preserves the relative order of items with equal keys.

Insertion sort and mergesort are stable (but not selection sort or shellsort)
never move a equal element pass another one, not have long distance exchange
