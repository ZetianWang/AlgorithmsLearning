Stack: LIFO
Queue: FIFO

Stack
Lined-list implementation:
1. Every operation takes constant time in the worst case. 
2. Uses extra time and space to deal with the links. 
Resizing-array implementation:
1. Every operation takes constant amortized time.
2. Less wasted space.



Iterators
What is an Iterable? Has a method that return an Iterator.
What is an Iterator? Has methods hasNext() and next().
Why make data structure Iterable? Java support elegant client code. (we can use foreach statement)
